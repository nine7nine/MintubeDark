This is a personal fork of Mintube.

# Reason behind forking: 

1. Dropping legacy code (< sdk23) and an attempt to modernize code
2. fix all of the bugs that annoy me and implement needed fatures; implement auto-rotate (and fixing webview refreshing on auto-rotate), implement immersive mode (sticky) on fullscreen player, redo parts of the UI and change all of the colours (remove legacy code), add higher video quality modes, fix as many of the reported issues generated by Lint (as I can, with my limited Java Knowledge. lol), remove wide screen mode (it's semi-broken in landscape mode anyway), fix rendering issue (aka: drawing white bg in the player), restrict local file system access, enforce https, etc, etc...
3. to Learn more about Java, Android Studio, Lint, etc - by using a smaller app/project; where the codebase isn't gianormous or incredibly hard or difficult to understand.
6. Development of Mintube has been slow with almost zero commits this year.
5. for fun ;)
